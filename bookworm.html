<h2>Dawn</h2>
<p>Folding back the curtain, the little girl looked out the window
with longing. She was not looking at anything in particular, for
there was nothing to look at. All she could see were shadows
scattered in an endless black sea. She sighed ever so slightly,
gently disturbing the innocent silence of the morning. For though she
could not see, she was well aware of what lay beyond the shadows, on
the other side of the dark ocean. Though she could not see, she could
hear its silent calling of her name.</p>
<p>The girl took a sudden glance behind her, as if afraid that her
thoughts might have been heard. But there was no one. Turning back to
the window, she realized that she had allowed the curtain to drop
back to its position, guarding the crystal ball of adventure. But she
did not lift it back up. Her hands would not move.</p>
<p>Then the girl spun around and slid off the bed. A new spark was in
her eyes. She tiptoed to the door and looked both ways, but the
hallway was empty. As she made her way to the stairs, she began to
notice a faint voice from below. "Tick, tock," said the voice of
time. "Tick, tock."</p>
<p>Rather than argue with the voice and cause a commotion that would
surely end this adventure, the girl decided to join it. "Tip, toe,"
went the girl's foot. "Tip, toe."</p>
<p>Down the stairs she went, one at a time. As the voice of time grew
louder, a new chorus emerged. A gentle percussion of patience and
stealth echoed through the house. "Tip, tick, toe, tock. Tip, tick,
toe, tock."</p>
<p>Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs, the girl did not slow her
rhythm. No, she would not let her companion down. One tip and toe and
a time, she edged her way closer and closer to the door. "Tip,
tick, toe, tock."</p>
<p>Finally she reached the door. There was nowhere left to carry out
her tips and toes! But she would not be outdone by time. No, she was
swifter than that. Without losing a beat, tip, or toe, she turned the
knob, stepped through the doorway, and pulled the door shut behind
her with a forceful slam. "Tip, tick, toe, tock. Tip, tick, toe,
tock. Tip, tick toe, tock, tip, tick, toe, tock - bang!"</p>
<p>And then there was silence and darkness. The girl halted and took
in a deep breath of the cool morning air. She shivered, feeling the
coldness touch her bare arms. She wore nothing but her thin yellow
nightgown. It was just her and the wild, face to face. She was
afraid, but not intimidated.</p>
<p>Then the darkness began to have color, and the shadows began to
take shapes. The girl could now make out the trees just a hundred
yards away, and she began to run, straight towards them. Like a
gazelle she glided, beautiful and escaping a very present danger. She
knew what she was running from, but she refused to think about it.
Else the thought of it would paralyze her, and she would most
certainly fall prey.</p>
<p>Just as she darted into the cover of the woods, she heard a voice
call out from behind. "Dawn! Dawn!"</p>
<p>But she did not stop. Though the forest was dense, the girl was
small, and also very agile. She ducked under low branches, tumbled
over rotting logs, and pushed defiantly past the spiked bushes which
in return ripped through her delicate skin. She cried out in pain,
but did not stop.</p>
<p>Finally she reached the other end of the trees. Wearily the girl
stepped out into the open, and slowly raised her head. There,
towering before her, was the hill. Covered in weeds, its silhouette
stood proudly before the fading darkness of the sky.</p>
<p>She marched straight into the grass, which rivaled her in height.
The pods at the top of each stem exploded into puffs of little
seedlings as she brushed past them. Nature's confetti cascaded upon
her as she continued up the slope, celebrating her arrival at this
most lonesome of parties.</p>
<p>Then the slope flattened out, and the girl found herself at the
top. But she still could not see past the tall stalks of grass. Was
this it? Had she come all this way only to be outdone by some weeds?
No, the girl would not give up just yet. She spotted an especially
large shadow to her right, and made her way towards it. It was a
rock - smooth, silver, and tall. At the top there was a flat spot,
perfect for sitting on. The top, however, was twice as high as the
girl.</p>
<p>The girl looked up at the rock, and the rock glanced scornfully
back down at her. But she had not been outdone by the clock or the
thorns or the grass. She would not be outdone by the rock. She took a
run and a leap, and clasped onto a crevice near the top of the rock.
There she dangled for a moment - a bleeding 5-year-old girl in a torn
yellow nightgown, hanging by a single finger onto a rock at the top
of a hill. So close was she, that anyone else would have been
satisfied and let go. But she was not anyone else.</p>
<p>With a cry, she reached up with her other hand and grabbed the top
edge of the rock. Then she let go of her grip on the crevice and
grabbed the top edge with both hands. From that position she pulled
herself up onto the rock and slid her feet out in front of her. She
was sitting on top of the rock, and, as far as she was concerned, on
top of the world.</p>
<p>Before her rested a beautiful scene. A deep blue river slithered
its way between many evergreen hills down below while the silhouettes
of hawks patrolled the horizon. And slowly the horizon began to
undergo a transformation, fading from the dark blue of the night into
the fiery red of the morning. The red became orange, the hawks flew
to the wayside, and then - then it happened. A yellow circle peeked
over the horizon, and suddenly the valley burst into blue and green
and the sky into a paler blue. Yellow daggers emanated from the
circle and slayed the agents of the night once and for all. Even the
girl recoiled at their piercing thrust. Finally, she knew who she
was. She knew what this was. It was Dawn.</p>
<p>"Dawn! Dawn!"</p>
<p>The girl spun around in horror. "Get down from there! You're
crazy! What's wrong with you? Why can't you do as you're
told?!" A shadow emerged from the trees below and charged up the
hill towards her. It was carrying a stick.</p>
<p>The shadow reached the rock and stopped, but the stick did not. It
came crashing upon the girl's back before she could react, and the
impact sent her flying off the other side of the rock. She collapsed
onto the ground with a thud, conscious but too stunned to scream.</p>
<p>But the stick still did not stop. It came crashing down upon her
again. "Dawn! Bad girl! Bad, bad girl!" The stick fell upon her
three more times.</p>
<p>By this time, tears were streaming down her cheeks. Her arms were
now not only covered in scratches from the thorns, but bruises from
the stick. Covering her head with her hands to protect herself, she
turned around and looked up with her little wide eyes at the shadow
towering above her. "I'm sorry, Daddy," she sobbed. "I'm
sorry."</p>
